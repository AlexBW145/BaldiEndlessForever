# Prerequisites
- [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
- [MTM101BaldAPI 8.1](https://gamebanana.com/mods/383711)
- Visual Studio

Put the BepInEx core DLLs and the MTM101BaldAPI dll into a folder named "Dependencies", it's likely it doesn't already exist so you need to create it.
Load up the solution in Visual Studio and you should be able to build.

The resources folder must be put in StreamingAssets/Modded and renamed to "mtm101.rulerp.baldiplus.endlessfloors".
